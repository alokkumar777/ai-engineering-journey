In python everything is an object.

There is not primitive or reference type thing.
What is an Object??
  - value
  - type
  - method

And really what I think is in python variable is not a container not a memory it is just a name that is pointing to an object like a -----> 10 (object)

String interpolation - process if inserting variables and expressions into a string

Slicing - When you extract some porting of the string or you want to work with specific part of it.
